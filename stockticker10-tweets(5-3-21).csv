Up pops $OXY on the app...

Whale says puts... I like it. They are 0.33. I buy 10.

It's a relatively cheap stock so I take my profits quicker on this one... it's unlikely to drop to 15$ unlike $NVDA which has room to fall.

First, $NVDA 450 Puts 3/05/21 expiring tomorrow.

Never assumed this would reach 450 today but the cons were cheap, the stock was dropping and so was everything else. So I entered at 0.29 after I waited a little bit for a small pullback.

I bought 10 cons.

$ZM Down 100pts in 3 days. If ZM fails at 341 tomorrow it can test the key lvl 333. Watch to see if 333 breaks to see a continuation lower towards 325. 

Be careful as ZM might bounce at 333. ZM can see 341, 351 if it does bounce.
